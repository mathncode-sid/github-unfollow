# GitHub Unfollowers Checker

A Python script that identifies GitHub users you follow who **do not follow you back**. This is a read-only script — it **does not make any changes** to your account.

---

## Features

* Lists users you follow who don’t follow you back
* Supports GitHub pagination for large accounts
* Securely uses a Personal Access Token stored in a `.env` file
* Optional CSV export (can be added)

---

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with **`read:user`** and **`user:follow`** scopes

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-unfollow.git
cd github-unfollow
```

2. Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Or manually:*

```bash
pip install requests python-dotenv
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GITHUB_USERNAME=your-github-username
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token
```

> **Important:** Add `.env` to `.gitignore` so your token isn’t exposed.

---

## Usage

Run the script:

```bash
python unfollow.py
```

The script will:

1. Fetch the list of users you follow
2. Fetch the list of users who follow you
3. Compare both lists
4. Print the users who don’t follow you back

### Example Output

```
Fetching followers and following lists...

You are following 42 users.
You have 27 followers.

Users not following you back (15):
- alice-dev
- johnnycodes
- theopenai
...
```

---

## Notes

* **Read-only script:** No actions are performed on your GitHub account.
* **Rate limits:** GitHub allows 5,000 authenticated requests per hour. The script uses one request per page of followers/following.
* **Pagination:** Automatically handles accounts with many followers/following.

---

## Optional Improvements

* Export results to a CSV file
* Highlight mutual followers
* Add a simple GUI using `tkinter` or `streamlit`
